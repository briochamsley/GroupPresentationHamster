To use the provided scripts with the test-data, you first need to run the CreateRules.bat-File. Afterwards you need to change the data-directory in both PyScripts (first line) and run the BufferQGisPyScript.py ind QGIS and the AnalysisPyScript.py in Grass GIS.

The PreProcessing.bat can be used instead of the CreateRules.bat, it donwloads the data, unzips it, reproject and patch/extract it and creates the rules as well. You need to have wget installed though.
